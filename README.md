C++ Programs

Welcome to my collection of C++ programs! This repository encompasses a variety of C++ code snippets and programs that I've developed to enhance my understanding of the language and its applications. The programs range from fundamental concepts to more advanced data structures and algorithms.
üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on specific topics or concepts in C++:

    Basics C++: Fundamental programs covering syntax, control structures, and basic operations.

    Basic Algorithms: Implementations of classic algorithms such as sorting and searching.

    Binary Tree: Programs related to binary tree structures and traversals.

    Graphs: Graph representations and traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.

    Queue: Implementations and applications of queue data structures.

    Recursion: Examples demonstrating recursive problem-solving techniques.

    Sliding Window + Two Pointer: Solutions employing sliding window and two-pointer strategies.

    Trees: General tree data structures and associated algorithms.

    for_loop: Exercises and examples utilizing for-loops.

    linked list: Singly and doubly linked list operations.

    miscellaneous: A variety of programs that don't fit into the other categories.

    stacks: Stack implementations and related problems.

    strings: String manipulation and algorithmic challenges.

    vectors: Usage and operations involving the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) vectors.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To compile and run the programs:

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/singhpratik5/cpp-programs.git

Navigate to the desired directory:

cd cpp-programs/<directory_name>

Compile the program:

g++ -o program program.cpp

Run the executable:

    ./program

Ensure you have a C++ compiler like g++ installed on your system.
üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning tool to practice and reinforce my C++ programming skills. By tackling a wide range of problems and concepts, I aim to build a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.

I'm open to suggestions and improvements. If you have any feedback or ideas, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
